# LiteSVM (NodeJS)

This is the NodeJS wrapper for [LiteSVM](https://github.com/LiteSVM/litesvm). It brings best-in-class Solana testing
to NodeJS, giving you a powerful, fast and ergonomic way to test Solana programs in TS/JS.

For a standard testing workflow, LiteSVM offers an experience superior to `solana-test-validator` (slow, unwieldy)
and `bankrun` (reasonably fast and powerful, but inherits a lot of warts from `solana-program-test`).

## Minimal example

This example just transfers lamports from Alice to Bob without loading
any programs of our own. It uses the [jest](https://jestjs.io/)
test runner but you can use any test runner you like.

```ts
import { LiteSVM } from "litesvm";
import {
	PublicKey,
	Transaction,
	SystemProgram,
	Keypair,
	LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
} from "@solana/web3.js";

test("one transfer", () => {
	const svm = new LiteSVM();
	const payer = new Keypair();
	svm.airdrop(payer.publicKey, BigInt(LAMPORTS_PER_SOL));
	const receiver = PublicKey.unique();
	const blockhash = svm.latestBlockhash();
	const transferLamports = 1_000_000n;
	const ixs = [
		SystemProgram.transfer({
			fromPubkey: payer.publicKey,
			toPubkey: receiver,
			lamports: transferLamports,
		}),
	];
	const tx = new Transaction();
	tx.recentBlockhash = blockhash;
	tx.add(...ixs);
	tx.sign(payer);
	svm.sendTransaction(tx);
	const balanceAfter = svm.getBalance(receiver);
	expect(balanceAfter).toBe(transferLamports);
});
```
Note: by default the `LiteSVM` instance includes some core programs such as
the System Program and SPL Token.

## Installation

```
yarn add litesvm
```

## Contributing

Make sure you have Yarn and the Rust toolchain installed.

Then run `yarn` to install deps, run `yarn build` to build the binary and `yarn test` to run the tests.
